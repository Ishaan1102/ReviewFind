# ReviewFind

## Introduction
ReviewFind is an innovative movie recommendation system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze user reviews and suggest movies based on specific descriptive terms found in those reviews. Unlike traditional systems that rely on genre or user ratings, ReviewFind focuses on the qualitative aspects of user reviews to provide more personalized and relevant movie recommendations.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Offers recommendations by analyzing descriptive terms like "gritty," "heartwarming," or "intense" from movie reviews.
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Capable of suggesting movies across various streaming platforms, not limited to a single ecosystem.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Utilizes a dataset of approximately 8 million reviews across 250,000 movies, ensuring a robust and extensive recommendation pool.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to find movies that match their tastes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For backend development and data processing.
- **spaCy**: For implementing NLP tasks.
- **Flask**: For the web application framework.
- **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**: For frontend development.

## How It Works
- **Input**: Users input their preferences or select specific keywords.
- **Processing**: The system processes reviews to find matches based on NLP analysis.
- **Output**: Movies matching the input criteria are displayed to the user.
